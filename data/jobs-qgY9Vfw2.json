You will help create and extend automated testing frameworks, and design and build automated tests that allow the whole team to move faster. You will deeply understand what is important to our business, and make good decisions about what to test, how deeply to test it, and the risks incurred by what we're not testing. A large part of our testing happens automatically after every build of the software, leaving us time to focus on the important changes that don't lend themselves to automated tests.&nbsp;<br /><br />We need first class software engineers that are interested in building software to validate and verify our products. We need someone as passionate about helping our customers as they are passionate about technology and good engineering practices. We're an agile shop, but we're not fanatics following a religion: we take the pieces that work for us and improve our processes from there. Most importantly, we're still a work in progress, so when we bring you in, you have a lot of room to influence what we do and how we do it.<br /><br /><strong>About You:<br /></strong>&bull; You have 2+ years of professional test software development experience, as well as a strong web testing background.<br />&bull; You have strong scripting skills, especially working with Ruby, Perl or the latest and greatest language of the day.<br />&bull; You function well in a fast-paced, informal environment where constant change is the norm and the bar for quality is set high.<br />&bull; You are extremely comfortable working with SQL and databases for test set-up and trouble-shooting purposes.<br />&bull; You are comfortable enough with Linux to set-up and maintain your own QA environment.<br />&bull; You know that insuring a good customer experience trumps testing to the spec, because sometimes even the specs have bugs.<br />&bull; You love to figure out how software has been built and pride yourself on your ability to break it.<br />&bull; You enjoy debugging applications to get to the source of the potential issue.<br />&bull; You are self-managing and have the ability to adjust to competing priorities and allocate your time as necessary to get the job done.<br />&bull; You have a BS in Computer Science or another analytical field.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />OPOWER is an Equal Opportunity Employer<br />&nbsp;<br />WE DO SPONSOR VISAS/TRANSFERS WHEN APPLICABLE.<br />NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.&nbsp;THE FASTEST WAY TO GET A RESPONSE IS BY SENDING YOUR RESUME TO THE LINK BELOW.&nbsp;<br />NO EXTERNAL RECRUITERS.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;","briefdescription":{}},{"id":"oSQlVfwI","title":"Software Engineering - East Coast","requisitionId":"Critical Hire","category":"Engineering","jobtype":"Full-Time","location":"Arlington, VA, United States","date":"10/22/2010","detail-url":"http://hire.jobvite.com/CompanyJobs/Job.aspx?c=qgY9Vfw2&j=oSQlVfwI","apply-url":"http://hire.jobvite.com/CompanyJobs/Apply.aspx?c=qgY9Vfw2&j=oSQlVfwI","description":"About the Job:<br /> &nbsp;<br /> OPOWER's Software Engineering team will<br /> <ul> <li>Write clean Java code using the tools of your choice</li> <li>Add exciting new features to our product (you'll ship within the first month of working here)</li> <li>Collaborate with other engineers every step of the way</li> <li>Be involved in every part of the process, from feature design to deployment</li> </ul> In addition to working on an inspiring product with an engineering team that's \"smart and gets things done\", working&nbsp;at OPOWER beats working at some large faceless consulting company, and here's why.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Awesome job features found at OPOWER:<br /> <ul> <li>Mac/Linux laptop that you manage with no restrictions</li> <li>Unfettered access to the internet to get your job done</li> <li>Use the IDE and tools of your choice</li> <li>Work on a product that's literally changing the world</li> <li>No dress code</li> <li>Flexible hours</li> <li>Ship features within first month of work</li> <li>Architects who code</li> </ul> <br /> About You<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Above all, we want someone who is \"smart and gets things done\".

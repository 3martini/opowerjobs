                <strong>About the Company</strong>
                <p>Opower is an energy efficiency and smart-grid software company. Our products encourage energy efficiency by empowering people to make better decisions about the ways they use energy every day. With industry-leading data analytics and a unique approach to customer engagement, we're changing the way the world understands personal energy consumption, and helping more than 40 utilities---including 8 of the US’s 10 largest—achieve unprecedented, sustainable energy savings in tens of millions of households.</p>
                <p>In March 2010, President Obama gave his national policy speech on green-job creation from our office in the Washington, DC area. In September of 2010, we were named a Technology Pioneer by the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, for creating "innovations that will have a critical impact on the future of business and society.” In January, the Washington Post called us one of "5 Companies that will Lead in 2011," and in March, the Wall Street Journal named us a Top 10 Cleantech company. By the end of this year, the energy we save will equal a third of the power produced by the entire US solar industry, and have the impact of effectively removing 50,000 homes from the grid.</p>
                <p>Founded in 2007, Opower has offices in Arlington, Virginia, and San Francisco, California. Our rapidly expanding team includes software engineers, product specialists, behavioral scientists, statisticians, marketing experts, infographic designers, and efficiency advocates.</p>

        <p>At OPOWER, we're working to make the world a better place by promoting energy efficiency. And we have some great ideas on how to make that happen.</p>
        <p>But great ideas aren't enough. What distinguishes our product and our potential are the people who make it happen. At OPOWER, our relentlessly committed and talented individuals bring our ideas to life. It's our team that's responsible for what we have been able to achieve to date. And what we've achieved is no small number â€“ by the end of this year, the energy savings we've generate will match the power generated by one third of our nation's solar industry.  That's 1,000 homes off the grid for every employee here.</p>
        <p>We encourage you to <a href="/all" title="join us">join us</a> as we continue to build our business. You will be challenged. You will develop new skills. You will work very hard, but you'll also <a href="/working-here" title="have a lot of fun">have a lot of fun</a>. The best part? One day, you might be able to tell your friends and family that you helped change the world.</p>

            The DC Metro Area offers a wide array of opportunities. Whether it's enjoying a show at the Kennedy Center, hiking in the District's more than 200,000 acres of parkland or getting a drink at a craft beer house, the area offers activities for everyone. The best part â€“ if you're interested in it, there's a good chance that someone else at OPOWER is interested, too.

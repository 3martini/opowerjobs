 As you can tell we are hiring.  And we are looking for VERY smart people.
 There are several very difficult puzzle hidden on this site.
 You will need to write code in your language of choice to solve them.
 We don't expect anyone to find all of the puzzles.


 Of all the applicants we received this year, you are but one of them.
 Set yourself apart.
 Do not be afraid of saying too much in your cover letter.
 Include open source projects you've worked on.  Or start one before you apply.  It helps.

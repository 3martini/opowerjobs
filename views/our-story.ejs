    <h2>From $300/month cubicle to $30M/year company</h2>
    <h3>And our impact is growing even faster than we are!</h3>

    <div class="large-text space-bottom">

        <p>We signed our first client in 2007 while sitting at a rented desk in San Francisco. Since then, we’ve grown to become a well-capitalized business with $30M in annual revenue serving 37 utilities—including 7 of America’s 10 largest. Our product innovations now reach nearly 5 million homes. </p>

        <p>Together with our clients and their customers, we’re saving energy, saving them money, and directly helping to reduce global carbon emissions. And our positive impact increases every single day. </p>

        <div class="span-10">
            <p>OPOWER founders Dan Yates and Alex Laskey met their first week of college. After graduation, Dan started a software business he later sold to Houghton Mifflin, while Alex ran political campaigns. Though Alex has always been an environmentally aware outdoorsman, it was during a journey from Alaska to Patagonia that Dan became truly aware of ways our demand for energy devastates the natural world.</p>

        When OPOWER was starting up in 2007, everyone was abuzz about cleaner energy production using renewable energy sources, like the sun and wind. Dan and Alex knew that, though critically important, these sources wouldn’t be tapped in the short-term. The answer to reducing our carbon emissions right now was curbing wasteful use of the types of energy we produce today.

            <p>1.4 billion utility bills are mailed to customers each year. These mailings, they realized, were perfect vehicles for reaching hundreds of millions of households with energy-saving ideas. Come to find out, Robert Cialdini—a renowned behavioral scientist—had academic research that supported their initial ideas about prompting people to change the way they use energy at home. Together, they set about designing a prototype, which they then took on the road to two of America’s major energy markets, California and Texas. The amount of interest they received from utilities, state legislators, and environmental groups soon led to Dan and Alex securing their first round of venture capital funding from NEA. </p>

We’re doubling the total amount of energy we’re helping North Americans save at home every six months: by the end of 2010, the amount of energy we’ll have saved will equal a third of the energy produced by entire US solar industry—and we’re having a great time doing it! We’re a company that’s deeply committed to transparency and to our staff, and we were built with collaboration, collective success, and quality of life for all in mind. </p>
